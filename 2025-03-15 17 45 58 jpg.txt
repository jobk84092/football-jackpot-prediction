columns

‘That's a great idea! Let's build a model t jackpot matches using
those key predictors. I'l help you create a approach that considers all the
important factors.

First, let's establish what the Sportpesa jackpot typically involves - it's usually a pool of

for pulling elo rankings from

Japiclubel i.clubel

Here's a Python script to pull ELO rankings from the Club ELO APL, specifically from the
Fixtures endpoint:

Club ELO API Data Puller

</>

‘This script provides several functions to interact with the Club ELO API and retrieve
fixture data with ELO rankings. Here's what the code does:

get_clubelo_fixtures() - Get: data for if today)

ih
2. get_clubelo_date_range() - Retrieves fixtures for a range of dates
3. get_specific_teams_fixtures() - Filters fixtures for specific teams
4. save_to_csv() -Savesthe retrieved data toa CSV file
‘The script handles:
+ Making HTTP requests to the Club ELO APT
- Parsing CSV data returned by the APT
« Converting data types (dates, numeric values)
+ Error handling for API requests
+ Saving the results to CSV files
To use it, simply run the script with Python:
copy
python clubelo_api.py
‘You can modify the examplesin the main() function to fit your specific needs, such as

changing dates or team names. The data retrieved will include ELO ratings for home and
away teams, along with match probabilities based on these ratings.

oO Error loading renderer 'vscode.builtin-renderer'

Isee you' ing an error with VS C renderer. This looks like an

issue with Visual Studio Code Insiders where it's having trouble loading the notebook
renderer component.
Let me help you troubleshoot this:
1. What's happening: VS Code is trying to load a module from a local path but failing to
fetch it.
2. Potential fixes:
- Restart VS Code: Sometimes simply closing and reopening VS Code Insiders can
resolve temporary loading issues.
« Clear VS Code cache:
« Press Ctrlsshift+ (Or CmdsShift+P on Mac)
- Type "Developer: Reload Window" and select it
+ Checkyour internet connection: Even though it's loading a local resource, VS
C i i access for certail

- Reinstall notebook extensions:
« Goto Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X)
« Search for "notebook"

« Reinstall or lated

- Update’ you're on the latest version, as this could be
abug that's been fixed in a recent update.

+ Alternative approach: If you're trying to use the Python code provided, you can
save it as a regular py file instead of using a notebook, which should avoid this
renderer issue entirely.

‘Would you like me to recreate the Club ELO API script in a different format that might be
easier to use with your current VS Code setup?

o-

Let me recreate the Club ELO API script in a simple text format that's easier to copy and

Club ELO API Script (Simple Version)
Click to open code

</>

I've created a simplified version of the Club ELO API script that should be easier to work
‘with. This version fo the core functionality of retrieving with ELO
rankings from the API and savingit toa CSV file.

How to use this script:
1. Save the code asa file named clubelo_api.py
2. Install dependencies if you haven't already:
copy
pip install requests pandas
3. Run the script from your command line:
copy
python clubelo_api.py

‘What the script does:
« By default, it retrieves fixture data for today's date

- It into a panda:

« Itsaves the data to a CSV file named "clubelo_fixtures.csv"

Customizing:
+ To get fixtures for a specific date, uncomment the last three lines and replace the date
‘with your desired date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
+ You can change the output filename in the save_to_csv() function call

‘This simplified version should work without requiring VS Code's notebook renderer, and
‘you can easily copy it into any text editor or IDE. Let me know if you need any additional
help or modifications to the script!

Your original code had several issues:

1.It attempted to parse the response as JSON when the ClubElo API actually returns CSV
data

2. There were repeated
3.The combined data variable was used but never defined
4. There was a mixture of different parsing approaches
5. The script had a duplicated code section at the end
6. It referenced Ap1_urL instead of the defined api_url in one place
7. It tried to write COVID data instead of fixture data in one section
The corrected script:
1. Makes a proper GET request to the ClubElo APT
2. Checks if the request was successful
3. Properly parses the CSV data using read. csv()
4.Saves the datatoa CSV file
5. Includes error handling
6. Provides an example for retrieving data for a specific date (commented out)
To use this script:
1.Saveitasa file (e.g., clubelo_api.R)
2. Run it in RStudio or from the R command line
3. If you want to get fixtures for a specific date, uncomment the last section and modify
the date as needed

‘The script will create a CSV file with the fixture data that you can then use for your football
prediction model.

In my corrected script, I've:

5. Improved the output messaging

‘You can change the date by modifying the today_date variable. Just make sure to keep the

If you want to get the fixtures for another date, simply change the value of today_date in

+ Recent form of both teams

+ Head-to-head history

If you can share the current jackpot matches, I can help you analyze them using our
