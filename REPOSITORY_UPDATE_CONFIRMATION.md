## 🎯 **Session Summary**

### **What Was Accomplished:**
1. ✅ **Complete neural network system** built and tested
2. ✅ **Comprehensive analysis** of model performance
3. ✅ **Full documentation** created and saved
4. ✅ **All code files** properly organized and committed
5. ✅ **Repository updated** with all changes

### **Key Findings:**
- ❌ **Neural networks showed severe bias** (90% home predictions)
- ❌ **Poor performance** (~49% accuracy, barely better than random)
- ✅ **Traditional ML recommended** over neural networks
- ✅ **Complete infrastructure** built for future reference

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Focus on traditional ML models** (Random Forest, XGBoost)
2. **Improve feature engineering** instead of model complexity
3. **Use domain expertise** to guide modeling approach
4. **Monitor performance** continuously
