# Football Jackpot Prediction Project

A machine learning project that attempts to predict football match outcomes for jackpot betting using historical data and advanced feature engineering.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict football match outcomes. While the model achieved some success (5/17 correct predictions on the latest Sportpesa Mega Jackpot), it serves primarily as a learning exercise in sports analytics and machine learning.

**Disclaimer:** This project is for educational purposes only. The model is not suitable for actual betting purposes.

## 📊 Features

- Historical football match data analysis (2000-2025)
- Advanced feature engineering including:
  - Rolling averages
  - Win streaks
  - Clean sheets
  - Elo ratings
  - Betting odds
  - Head-to-head statistics
- Ensemble machine learning model
- Jackpot outcome prediction
- Model evaluation and visualization

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- XGBoost for gradient boosting
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- SQLite for data storage
